General Description:
    The room you find yourself in is spacious. The vines wrap themselves around anything that they can find, the legs of both the desk and the bed being covered. There is a forboding feeling coming from this room like this is something that you were not to find, a large rug sits in the center of the room, It looks expensive, you find yourself wondering if this was payed for by the captain himself or by the company. The door behind you closes with a squish as more vines attempt to make their way inside, They seem to take little interest in you which seems odd, but you won't question it as long as you are safe, 

Observations:
    A desk sits flush against one of the walls, its once pristine white finish not worn away and covered with the black goopy vines that you have become well accustom too
        Look:
            On the desk sits a terminal its screen sitting idly, a file is open, the mission briefing, or at least what seems to be the mission briefing:
                
                
                Mission Briefing:
                    Captain
                    
                    Your mission is simple, keep the station running at peak efficiency, make sure that your crews moral stays high and that you are trading goods with the passing starships, make sure that you read through the star station manual that you were given before being flown out too the station, any issues that may arise you are too deal with at you own discretion, you and solely you are in charge of this station. Your crew may be small but they are are also mighty, make sure that you acquaint yourself with them. Your quarters are fitted with a bio-metric scanner, your bio signature has already been added, you may also add other crew members to the scanner if you see fit. Good luck captain, and make sure you meet your monthly quota.

                Closing the file you see what you can only assume is a photo of the captains family, you wonder if they know what has happened out here, scanning the desktop you notice a file labeled "Captains Logs". Reading these may be a breach of privacy, but may also have some vital information talking about what happened here

                Read the file?:
                    Yes:
                        Opening the file you see that its more of a file sorting system, opening up the most recent entry you begin to read:
                            Sol 212/2549464.5 (2268/2/5) Captains Log:
                            
                            Things have only gotten worse, those dastardly black vines have taken over half the ship, getting into the bridge is almost impossible and even as we speak they continue to make their way into my room, Dr Harris has been searching for a way to combat whatever this thing is, but its just me and him left alive and i'm not feeling too good, I fear that today may be one of my last, Whoever is reading this, whether it be you Harris, or a rescue crew, I warn you, get out while you can, there is no stopping this thing, there is a sample in the medbay of whatever this thing is, take it, take it and get out, the escape pods currently lack the fuel to fire but there should be just enough in the bridge, if you can even get into the bridge, I pray that you brought your own ship and have enough fuel to get out of here. And to whom is reading this, I ask one thing of you, the request of a man afraid he has only a few days left, In the drawer next too my bed there is a lock box, the code to unlock it is 3715, inside is a medal, the last I received, along with a holo-disk please take these and give them to my Daughter, Now I end this log as I must go see Harris, I need to know if he has made any progress.

                    No:
                        After all that you have seen here, reading the diary of a man you don't know is the last thing on your mind

    A bed sits neatly made pressed into the corner of the room next too the bed sits a small drawer:
        Bed:
        The captain must have made the bed before leaving for the med bay, or well whoever was last in here, for all you know the vines made the bed but they don't exactly seem like the type too do that. Sitting on the foot of the bed is a captains uniform, You think it may fit you
            Try it on?:

                Yes:
                    You take the uniform, attempting too put it on your metallic body, eventually after some struggle you are able to get the uniform on, you approach the mirror in the corner of the room and look at yourself, pointing some very crude finger guns at the reflection you see standing before you, "Looking good" you think too yourself.
                No:
                    I should leave this here, its not mine too take

        Drawer:
            The drawer is largely unremarkable save for a lock keeping the top drawer locked

                Correct code entered (3715):
                    Inputting the code you hear a satisfying click as the lock slides open, open the draw that once with held its secrets from you, you look inside too find a medal, taking it and flipping it over you see it was issued to one Captain Yaris
                        Medal Obtained
                     Bellow sits a holo-disk and a keycard, the keycard you assume will give you access to the bridge but the holo-disk you are unsure about, a label on the disk reads "For my dearest Opel", something the captain recorded for a loved one, I should take this and make sure it gets too the intended person.

                        Purple KeyCard Obtained
                        Holo-Disk Obtained

    On the wall sits a decorative sword:
        Taking it down from the wall carefully you can tell that this is more than just decoration just by the way it feels in your grip, this thing could cause some serious damage, and going off the wear on the blade it probably has seen quite a bit of use, saying this, it seem sharp enough, could be useful.

        Sword Obtained
