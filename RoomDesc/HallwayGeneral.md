Hallway 1:
    General Description:
        Yep this is indeed a hallway nothing really special about it, it gets you from point A to point B, That's all it really needs to do, This particular hallway seems to have a bulkhead segmenting it off from its other hallway brothers. M

    Observations:
        (No Keycard)
            You approach the door and try turning the twist valve 
            No use It's locked, there must be a keycard around here somewhere
        (With Keycard)
            You approach the Bulkhead pressing the keycard to the scanner 
            There is a small beep and then a loud thud, you test the twist valve on the door to find it moves freely, after a few turns the door opens and you find myself looking at more hallway


Hallway 2:
    General Description:
        Vines can be seen covering the walls of this hallway where there was once red and white paint there is now black sludgy vines, they move in an unnatural way, pulsating as if they had a heartbeat it is rather off putting but still you continue onwards, until you are met with yet another door.

        Observations:
            Walking down the hallway you notice a few things

            About halfway down the hall there are a couple windows that look out into the vast empty expanse that we call space
                Staring out the window you take a moment to reflect on the things:
                    Default:
                        Staring out into the vast emptiness you think about what might have happened here, what caused the crew to vanish? Why did they do so with no communication to anyone? Whats with those black vines?, There is more to this than you originally thought, You have too get to the bottom of what happened here, if not for the company, for the families of those that have vanished from the ship.
                    Wearing Captains Uniform:
                        Damn I look good you think too yourself
            
            You approach the door cautiously, everyone know that doors are the number one cause of door related accidents on space stations

                Without Key:
                    You try to open the door but no matter how much strength you can muster you are bested by the door, we shall see who is laughing once you find that keycard

                With Key:
                    It takes you a moment to find the scanner for the keycard, its covered by the black vines that can be seen all over this section of the ship, You press the card to the reader and much like before there is a beep, this one louder than the other door, and the door is now open, although its heaver than the one from earlier. Looking through the door the black vines have fully taken over the walls, they weave their way through the doors and some even run across the floor, the pulsating that you noticed earlier is even more exemplified in these vines. One more door stands between me and the Bridge of the ship maybe you can find some answers there.
