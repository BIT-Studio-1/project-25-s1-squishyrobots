Hallway 1:
    General Description:
        Yep this is indeed a hallway nothing really special about it, it gets you from point A to point B, That's all it really needs to do, This particular hallway seems to have a bulkhead segmenting it off from its other hallway brothers. Maybe I can find the keycard to open it somewhere around.

    Observations:
        I approach the Bulkhead pressing the keycard to the scanner
            There is a small beep and then a loud thud, I test the twist valve on the door to find it moves freely, after a few turns the door opens and I find myself looking at more hallway
