General Description:
    The shuttle bay is much like the ones you have seen before, though this one is noticeably more cluttered than most
    The ship you arrived on sits idle on one of the many gravity locks this for of landing pad is still pretty new but is still common place among the space stations in the system
    The lights in the bay seem to be flickering, must be something to do with the power, or lack there of
    The walls are white with subtle red accents, a common paint theme when it comes to {Name of company}


Observations:
    A quick scan of the room reveals a few objects of interest
    In the corner of the room you notice a steel crate, it looks like many of the others in the room but this one seems to be the only one lacking a lock on it
        It takes some effort but you finally get the steel crate open, Inside sits a fuel cell, these are typically used for powering space stations much like this one, this might come in handy

    A desk sits near the door too what you can only assume to be the rest of the ship
        Upon looking a little closer at the desk you notice a boarding pass, you can probably use this to gain access to the rest of the ship

    On the side of the landing pad sits a large cylindrical structure, made entirely out of steel and painted in a vibrant red
        Upon closer inspection you notice a little gauge with a needle pointing in the red section of the gauge, you surmise that this must be the canister that holds the fuel for the shuttles that land here, but at this present moment it seems to be empty and of little use
