The shuttle bay is much like the ones you have seen before, though this one is noticeably more cluttered than most
*Large steel boxes* line the walls, some with the cargo straps still on them, many of them still sit upon the anti-grav dollies that were used to get them off the ships 
The ship you arrived on sits idle on one of the many gravity locks this for of landing pad is still pretty new but is still common place among the space stations of the system
The lights in the bay seem to be malfunctioning might be something to do with the power, or lack there of
The walls are white with subtle red accents, a common paint theme when it comes to {Name of company}
A large cylindrical tank sits against the edge of the landing pad, the little needle displayed on the front tells you this is a fuel canister, most likely used for refueling the ships that land in the station
although it seems to be empty as of right now. By the door into what you can only assume to be the rest of the ship there is a check in desk
On the desk there is a *boarding pass* and a *scanner on the door*.
