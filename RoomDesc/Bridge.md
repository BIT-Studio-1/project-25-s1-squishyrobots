General Description:
    Walking into the bridge where you expect too see a large window showing the vast emptiness of space you find a large mass, from it vines snake off in every direction, there is no space within this room that isnt covered, at least when it comes to the walls and floor, the mass pulsates every so often, It lives, you think to yourself, It must do

Observations:
    Amongst the vines you are able to make out a few objects that may prove useful in your search
    In the center of the room sits a large table, embedded in the center is a large glass sphere, along the edges of the table sit screens, This must be the stations Star Chart
        Clearing the vines from the screen you are able to see that the destination of the station was set to an uninhabited sector of the universe, the captain must have been attempting to quarantine the station before whatever is infecting the ship could get out. If he couldn't do it maybe you could, this thing, whatever it is, is to potent and lets be honest you have probably spent too much time around it and are infected yourself. You swipe on the display finding the sector that was input by the captain, Selecting a random star in the sector a large button appears before you, "LAUNCH" now is the time to choose
            Launch:
                Hitting the button you hear the distant thud of the engines moving into place, and the sound of all the bulkheads closing, you may not return to command but you damn well will take this infestation out with you, a voice comes over the loud speaker "Prepare for light speed travel in 5" this is it, you just hope there isnt any form of life in this system, otherwise this will all be for naught. You carefully make your way over to the captains chair, sitting down the and tightening the harnesses around you the ship suddenly enters light speed, you blink, what feels like 4 years pass in a matter of seconds and when you open your eyes again, you notice, nothing, there is nothing here, no stars, no planets, only the emptiness of space, and the viney creature too keep you company, when suddenly
                CONNECTION LOST(Game ends)
            Leave:
                No, that too big of a risk, you think to yourself, you have no idea what is in that sector, for all you know there could be a civilization there, you would just suddenly dump this thing on them, no this needs to be dealt with here, and now
