The bridge is large, as to be expected its the main control center for the entire station
The large glass window at the very front of the ship allows you to see the vast emptiness of the universe around you
In the very center of the room there is what seems to be a large table
a hologram projects from a small sphere embedded in the center of the table
It shows a collection of nearby stars and galaxies, This must be their *star chart* you are sure of it
at the edges of the table sit *small screens* one of each edge, they display a digital representation of what the hologram is showing
this must be how they select the location that they are going too.
Not far from the window at the front of the ship is a desk with what seems to be a *terminal* on this desk also sits a *personal holopad*.
