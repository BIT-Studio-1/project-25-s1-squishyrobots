General Description    
    This store room seems, small, too small, you can barely turn around less you knock something off the shelves
    The size of the room explains why there is so much still left out in the bay
    The room is tall however, the shelves lining the walls go from floor to ceiling
    The walls in this room lacks the vibrant paint that the shuttle bay had is noticeably absent from this room
    On second thought that makes sense as only crew would typically see this space
