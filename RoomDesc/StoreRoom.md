This store room seems, small, too small, you can barely turn around less you knock something off the shelves
The size of the room explains why there is so much still left out in the bay
The room is tall however, the shelves lining the walls go from floor to ceiling
And against the back wall there is a set of *lockers* probably used too store the belongings of the crew that worked in this room
The shelves are lined with many useful items but a few of them jump out at you
those being the abundance of *tool kits* and *extra parts* as well as the emergency supplies that every space station comes with
*emergency rations* in case the greenhouse fails, and plenty of *oxygen canisters* as well.
Given that none of the emergency supplies have been touched the crew must have left in a hurry, or maybe not at all.
