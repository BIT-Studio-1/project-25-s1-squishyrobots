General Description    
    This store room seems, small, too small, you can barely turn around less you knock something off the shelves
    The size of the room explains why there is so much still left out in the bay
    The room is tall however, the shelves lining the walls go from floor to ceiling
    The walls in this room lacks the vibrant paint that the shuttle bay had is noticeably absent from this room
    On second thought that makes sense as only crew would typically see this space



Observations
    You scan the room for anything useful its rather hard to find anything with all the mess but a few things jump out at you
    The shelves have a few different items that could be useful
        After checking the shelves you manage to find a toolbox and some emergency rations
        Seeing how many emergency rations there are, whatever happened to this place must have happened quickly
        The toolbox contains the standard electro-wrench and hammer, but also has a few smaller parts that may have been used to help repair some things around the station

    Against the back wall you notice a set of 3 locker, painted in a dark blue the add and nice splash of colour too the otherwise dull room
        After trying each of the lockers all but one seems to be locked
        Opening the locker you find a pair of oxygen canisters, often used by repair crew personnel that need to venture outside the station to repair
        damage to the exterior and the solar panels
