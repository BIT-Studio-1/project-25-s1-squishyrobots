General Description
    The lab is pristine but that is too be expected, even one thing out of place could put an entire experiment off
    The counter tops are a surprisingly polished white marble, something you would not expect to see in a lab
    The room as a whole gives off almost a cold feeling, not physically, you can't quite figure out what it is
    In the center of the room on the floor there is what seems to be the remnants of a beaker the glass shards scattered on the floor



Observations
    Upon entering the room a few things immediately jump out at you
    A terminal sits on the counter, its green screen sitting idly waiting for an input (Power Dependent?)
        Luckily for you the whoever was using this terminal last is not very security conscious they seemed to have left themselves logged in
        Most of the files are logs from the various experiments that were performed in the lab, all dated and nicely sorted into folders
        You lightly skim through the various documents some much longer than other until you get to the final report
        This one seems different however

            The test was an astounding success, we were able to create artificial life. Everything was going according to plan until
            Francis dropped the beaker containing the specimen, then we lost sight of it. It seemed to shy away from the light however,
            maybe its got some high levels of photosensitivity and can't stay in the light too long, Lets just hope it dose'nt take
            us too long to find it. Unfortunately until we can find and contain the specimen we are unable to continue testing
            so begrudgingly I must end this report here.

    A few test tube racks are placed around the room, some on the shelves are empty but you see one that has some sort of liquid in it
        Approaching the test tube to get a better look at its contents, you notice it has a noticable glow coming from it
        The liquid is coloured a vibrant blue, similar to the colour used to represent lightning in comic books back on Terra Sol III
        Honestly it looks rather tasty. Just a taste could'nt hurt. Could it?
    
    The cupboards that sit above the counter seem to house a variety of items, but they unfortunately seemed to be locked (Key required)
        Inside the cupboards you find mostly paper, loose unused paper, along with empty flasks and beakers
        But inside on cupboard you find a keycard, maybe this unlocks a door somewhere in the ship
        You should take it with you
            The green keycard has been added too your inventory
