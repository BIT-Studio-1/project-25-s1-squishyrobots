General Description:
    You find yourself standing in a small hallway, down this hallway you can see around 12 rooms each room from what you can see is identical, a bed sits in the back corner, the corner closest to the door has a small shower and toilet, put in that position as to give as much privacy to the crew as possible. A small bookcase sits against one of the walls of each of the rooms, all of them are empty however, these are typically used to store the books that the crew members get out from the library.
