General Description
    The green house is hot a humid, well it would kinda have to be. Rooms like these are typically installed so stations can me "Self Sustaining" But its common knowledge that most stations buy food stuffs from passing vessels And the green room is just used as a backup incase something goes wrong. Lines of troughs filled with soil and plants can be see everywhere in this room, the harsh lights beaming down on them trying to emulate the light from the star produced in humanities home system.


Observations:
    This room has little in it so it doesn't take long too find something that catches your attention
    A small panel is imbedded in the wall, its screen fogged up due to the humidity in the room
        Wiping off the droplets of water you are able to see two bars, both turned up to the maximum that they can go too. The temperature and humidity controls you can't think of a reason to mess with these, you should just leave them as they are for now
