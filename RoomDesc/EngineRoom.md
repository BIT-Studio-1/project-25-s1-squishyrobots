As you enter the engine room the rhythmic wurr of the engine can be heard
Due to some sort of science that you are unable to understand the noise is isolated to this room
Regardless you always found the sound of the engine calming
The walls in this room are grey,seems they didnt bother painting these ones
There is a computer in the corner of the room
