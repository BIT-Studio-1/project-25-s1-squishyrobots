General Description
    The brig, every station has one, its just a matter of where they put it, seems like this particular designer decided right next to the most important part of the ship was a good idea, the laser grid that would normally make up the containment area seems to be absent at this given moment. Or at least they aren't being shown


Observations:
    In the back corner of the room sits a desk with a terminal, Typically a guard would be sitting there but given the current situation I'm not surprised to find the guard missing
        The screen of the terminal has a few applications open, the one immediately shown to you is the prisoner management system, a simple database showing the list of inmates, what they did and how long they need to be held before being transported to the systems judicial holding site. You scan the names to see if you recognize any of them. None immediately jump out at you however. The second application is the security monitoring system, it shows the feeds of a variety of cameras around the station. Nothing out of the ordinary that you can see, well apart from the absence of the crew but we knew this already.

    Hanging on the wall you can see a pair of handcuffs the key still in them
        Taking a closer look at the cuffs they seem beat up but still in working condition, they may prove useful if you need to put on your detective hat and solve a murder.
    
    There is a small room sectioned off from the rest of the room, separated by a simple door
        Trying the door you find it unlocked and inside is a restraint chair, its bulky and on the arm rest are leather straps, this relic is a remanent of Terra Sol 3, we have more effective ways of getting information now but sometimes these are still used.
