General Description:    
    Escape pods line the walls on either side of you
    Some are bigger than the others, those are typically saved for the important personnel At the end of the room there is a lever that reads "Release all escape pods" with a large red light above it, the lever is currently behind a glass shield that is locked and requires two keys too open. The hallway that goes between the rows of escape pods is tight


Observations
    Due to the lack of items in this room you are able to observe everything upon entering the room

    Bellow the "Release all escape pods" lever there is a book, the page count you estimate in the hundreds.
        Upon closer inspection you find its the user manual for the escape pods, its rather odd that its located out here and not in the escape pod itself but it may just be a maintenance manual.
    A door too one of the "Luxury" escape pods is slightly ajar you've always wondered what they looked like inside, now might be the only chance you have to look inside.
        Its surprisingly spacious, the chairs that line the walls are covered in a nice soft fabric, but you doubt that would make a difference when you are being flung through space at 1389km/h with no internal gravity lock, there is also a large table in the center on the pod, again you are not quite sure how useful that would be but your guess is that the "Investors" thought it would provide insentive for those climbing the corporate ladder. Other than that there is the standard oxygen tanks and food rations although there is more of those than in the standard pods.


    Along the back wall sits a rack of what seem to be parachutes
        You may think that parachutes in space are useless and that they have no place being on a space station, and normally you would be right but, due to an accident in Sol 648/2487397.5 (2098/28/2) where a space station fell from orbit and crash landed on Promerculus, All space stations are now required to provide personnel with a parachute in case of total catastrophic failure of the orbit thrusters.


    A key hangs from a hook on the back wall
        This must be one of the keys to launch the escape pod, you know its rather interesting that even now we still use simple metal keys to lock important things away, This is due to the simplicity of clone a key card.
